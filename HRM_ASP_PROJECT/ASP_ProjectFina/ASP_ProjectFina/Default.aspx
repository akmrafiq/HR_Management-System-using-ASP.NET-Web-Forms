        <h1>Human Resource Management</h1>
        <p style="text-align:justify" class="lead">Human Resource Management (HRM) is the function within an organization that focuses on the recruitment of, management of, and providing direction for the people who work in an organization. As you can imagine, all of the processes and programs that are touched by people are part of the HR kingdom.
The HRM department members provide the knowledge, necessary tools, training, administrative services, coaching, legal and management advice, and talent management oversight that the rest of the organization needs for successful operation.

            <h2>Organizational Objectives</h2>
            <p>
                HRM is a means to achieve efficiency and effectiveness. It serves other functional areas, so as to help them to attain efficiency in their operations and attainment of goals to attain efficiency.
Acquiring right man for the right job at right time in right quantity, developing through right kind of training, utilizing the selected workforce, and maintaining the workforce are the organizational objectives of HRM. Succession planning is an important issue to be taken up as a contemporary organizational objective.

            <h2>Societal Objectives</h2>
            <p>
                HRM must see that the legal, ethical, and social environmental issues are properly attended to. Equal opportunity and equal pay for equal work are the legal issues not to be violated. To take care of farmers (whose land has been acquired for the factory) and tribal’s (who are displaced by industries and mining companies) are the ethical issues.
The results are clear when these issues are not taken care of. To help the society through generating employment opportunity, creating schools and dispensaries, helping women empowerment are the social responsibility issues.

            <h2>Personal Objectives</h2>
            <p>
                In today’s world there is shortage of requisite talent. Employees are encouraged by competitive firms to change the jobs. HRM has the responsibility to acquire, develop, utilize, and maintain employees.
This would be possible only when the HRM helps employees to achieve their personal goals to get their commitment. Creating work-life balance for the employees is a personal objective.
